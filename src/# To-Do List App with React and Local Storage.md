# To-Do List App with React and Local Storage

This is a simple to-do list app built using React and local storage. It allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The app also features a separate section for completed tasks.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/to-do-list-app
cd to-do-list-app
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the development server:

```
npm start
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Features

The to-do list app has the following features:

- Add, delete, and mark tasks as completed
- Separate section for completed tasks
- Local storage to persist data

## Code Overview

The app is built using React and functional components. The main component is the `App` component, which contains the state and logic for the app.

The `App` component has the following state:

- `allTodos`: An array of all to-do items
- `newTitle`: The title of the new to-do item
- `newDescription`: The description of the new to-do item
- `error`: A flag indicating whether there is an error
- `completedTodos`: An array of completed to-do items
- `isCompleteScreen`: A flag indicating whether the completed tasks section is visible

The `App` component also has the following methods:

- `handleAddTodo`: Adds a new to-do item to the `allTodos` array
- `handleDeleteTodo`: Deletes a to-do item from the `allTodos` array
- `handleCompleteTodo`: Marks a to-do item as completed and moves it to the `completedTodos` array
- `handleDeleteCompletedTodo`: Deletes a completed to-do item from the `completedTodos` array

The app uses local storage to persist the data. The `allTodos` and `completedTodos` arrays are saved to local storage whenever they are updated.

## Step-by-Step Explanation
